title: About Me
description: A bit about my background, work as a web-developer and what I'm passionate about
content: |
  I'm a web designer and developer based in Melbourne. I design and host WordPress websites for various clients through my agency <a href="https://eadigital.com.au" target="_blank">EA Digital</a> and run an eco-startup called
  <a href="https://www.echoactive.com" target="_blank">Echo Active</a>. I also volunteer as a web designer and developer with
  <a href="https://treeproject.org.au" target="_blank">TreeProject</a>, a Victorian NGO.

  ### Work Experience

  I completed a one year contract for North Western Melbourne Primary Health Network as a front-end web developer in June 2023. I created custom components for a system that clinicians use to assess and refer clients, improved the system's UI/UX, and created wireframes and design briefs.

  The stack was built on Python and Flask, hosting was via AWS; I mainly worked with JavaScript, Jinja and Bootstrap. We used CI/CD and agile techniques, and collaborated via Git and Github.

  ### Background

  I've got degrees in Science and Law and have worked as a lawyer, in small and large businesses, and built a successful tutoring business from the ground up. See my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidhack" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> for more about my work history.

  ### My Passion

  I'm most interested in projects that create some positive social or environmental change and working in fields or businesses that align with these values.

  ### Beyond the Screen

  When I'm not coding, you might find me drumming, walking along the Merri Creek or enjoying time out in nature.&nbsp;
